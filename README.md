# JavaFX_LoginScreen

As I am working through expanding my knowledge and understanding of Java, I decided to go down the path of JavaFX.  This was a tutorial based project that took about 5hrs to complete.  

Some of the key features and tools used:
<ul>
  <li>JavaFX w/ SceneBuilder</li>
  <li>AWS RDS to create a MySQL DB</li> //the tutorial called for a localdatase..I am studying for cloud computing so I added this layer
  <li>MySql Workbench to create a test user</li>
  </ul>
  
  This project presented numorous challenges as I adventured into new territory.  Some of those being:
  <ul>
  <li>Setting up and configuring JavaSDK's (This one being 11)</li>
  <li>The previous led to runtime and compile time mismatches that needed resolving</li>
  <li>Managing file paths to load photos</li>
  <li>Gaining access to my AWS DB through Workbench</li>
  <li>Exploring Workbench with my nose to the grindstone to create tables and write statements</li>
  <li>Wiring up the database connection to the app (handling syntax)</li>
  </ul>
  
  There were many firsts to this assignment and my next goal is to build new scenes and start fleshing out a functioning application with a purpose.
